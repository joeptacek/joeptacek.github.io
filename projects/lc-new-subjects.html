title: LC New Subjects
---
<p>
  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/newSubjectsLC" target="_blank">LC New Subjects</a></i> is a Twitter bot for staying in touch with the latest subject heading updates from the Library of Congress (LC). LC releases these updates en masse, approximately once a month; <i>LC New Subjects</i> gathers these up and gradually Tweets its way through the heap.
</p>
<p>
  My basic goal with this project is to help updates from LC reach a broader audience. <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/weeklylists/" target="_blank">A partial listing of these updates</a> is published on the LC website; <a href="https://classweb.org/approved-subjects/" target="_blank">a more complete index</a> is also available, but it's a bit harder to find. By using Twitter to rebroadcast these lists, I hope to make it easier for librarians (and non-librarians) to monitor LC decision-making. I'm also hoping to create space for ongoing reflection and conversation regarding LC subject heading terminology—since Twitter is a public forum, anyone can share or add comments on updates that resonate in one way or another, e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/newSubjectsLC/status/1468504882781073414" target="_blank">the recent decision to finally cancel the "Illegal aliens" subject heading.</a>
</p>

  Under the hood, <i>LC New Subjects</i> depends on two Python scripts—one for scraping the LC website, and another for programmatically sending out Tweets. I've documented and published relevant code in two GitHub repositories, <a href="https://github.com/joeptacek/lc-scrape" target="_blank">lc-scrape</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joeptacek/lc-tweet" target="_blank">lc-tweet</a>.
