title: LC New Subjects
---
<p>
  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/newSubjectsLC" target="_blank">LC New Subjects</a></i> is a Twitter bot for staying in touch with the latest subject heading updates from the Library of Congress (LC). LC releases these updates en masse, approximately once a month; <i>LC New Subjects</i> gathers these up and gradually Tweets its way through the heap.
</p>
<p>
  My basic goal with this project is to help updates from LC reach a broader audience. LC publishes these updates online as HTML-formatted “approved lists.” The most obvious source for approved lists is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/weeklylists/" target="_blank">a webpage linked from LC’s Cataloging and Acquisitions portal</a>. What isn’t immediately obvious is that this webpage omits certain updates. Indeed, careful browsing uncovers <a href="https://classweb.org/approved-subjects/" target="_blank">a more complete index of approved lists</a> on LC’s sister site, Classification Web. Searching for approved lists, one gets the sense these resources aren’t primarily intended for public consumption—they’re available, but not easily discoverable. This is consistent with the larger subject heading revision process, which technically allows for public input, <a href="https://inevermetadataididntlike.wordpress.com/2018/05/22/suggestions-for-clarifying-the-lcsh-approval-process/" target="_blank">but is far less welcoming to LC outsiders</a>.
</p>
<p>
  By using Twitter to rebroadcast subject heading updates, I hope to make it easier for librarians (and non-librarians) to monitor LC decision-making. I also hope to create space for ongoing reflection and conversation regarding LC subject heading terminology—since Twitter is a public forum, anyone can share or add comments on updates that resonate in one way or another, e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/newSubjectsLC/status/1468504882781073414" target="_blank">the recent decision to cancel the "Illegal aliens" subject heading</a>.
</p>

  Under the hood, <i>LC New Subjects</i> depends on two Python scripts—one for scraping the LC website, and another for programmatically sending out Tweets. I've documented and published all relevant code in two GitHub repositories, <a href="https://github.com/joeptacek/lc-scrape" target="_blank">lc-scrape</a> and <a href="https://github.com/joeptacek/lc-tweet" target="_blank">lc-tweet</a>. The lc-scrape repository also contains <a href="https://github.com/joeptacek/lc-scrape/tree/master/archive" target="_blank">an archive of LC's approved lists</a>, both in HTML and JSON format.
